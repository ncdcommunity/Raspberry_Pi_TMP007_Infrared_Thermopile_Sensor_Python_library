#  TMP007

The Texas Instruments TMP007 is a fully-integrated micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) thermopile sensor that measures the temperature of an object without direct contact. The integrated thermopile absorbs the infrared energy emitted from the object in the sensorâ€™s field of view.

## Python
Download and install smbus library on Raspberry pi. Steps to install smbus are provided at:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/smbus-cffi/0.5.1

Download (or git pull) the code in pi. Run the program.

```cpp
$> python TMP007.py
```
The lib is a sample library, you will need to calibrate the sensor according to your application requirement.
